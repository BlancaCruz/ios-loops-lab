while allNumbers < 150 {
allNumbers += 1
print (allNumbers)
}

***

for i in rangeNumbers {
print (i)
}

***
## Question 3

if i % 2 != 0 {
print(i)}
}

***
## Question 5

while rangeOfNumbers.contains(index) {
index += 5
print(index)
}

***

var rangeOfNumbers = 1...40
var index = 0

for index in rangeOfNumbers {
if index % 10 == 7 {
print(index)}
}

***
## Question 7

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 3`

var rangeOfNumbers = 20...150
var index = 0

if index % 3 == 0 {
print(index)}
}

***

for i in rangeOfNumbers {

if i == 31 || i == 35 || 40 <= i && i <= 60 {
print(i)}
}

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

Answer: an infinite loop

// Your explanation here
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i < 9) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 0

while (i < 1000) {
i += 1
print(i)
}

```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 0

while (i < 1000) {
i += 1
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)}
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift

Answer: The difference between Loop 1 & 2 is the "repeat" function. Both loops have the same outputs using string interpolation as well. 

var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```

***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

Answer: Break function has limitations and stop once it finds its corresponding true statement. The Continue function is the opposite; it runs into the condition is met. 

for i in 2...20 {
if (i >= 5 && i <= 10){
continue
}
print(i)
}


***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}


for i in 2...10 {
if (i >= 6 && i <= 8){
break
}
print(i)
}

```

[x]1
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[x]8
[x]9
[x]10

***
## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[x]1
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}

It's checking the if condition of "y" when it is true it will continue to the outerloop. It will never print the interloop. 
```

***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

outerloop: for x in 1...10 {
innerloop: for y in 1...10 {
print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
}
}

***
## Question 21

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

var a = 10

outerloop: for x in 0...a {
innerloop: for y in 0...a {
if x - y <= 5 {
print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
}
}
}

***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift

var N = 5
var i = 1

while i<=N {
print(i * i)
i += 1
}

1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
var n = 2
var m = ""
var i = 0

for _ in i..<n {
for _ in i..<n {
m+="*"
i+=1
}
print(m)
}

**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
